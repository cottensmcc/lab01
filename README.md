## Introduction
Control structures are a very important topic in programming. In this lab, you will write a program that utilizes the if control structure. Make sure you have read Chapter 4 and watched the videos in the Week 10 Module before starting this lab. 

## Setup
Create a new file called `main.cpp`.

## Problem Statement

Write a program that prompts the user to input three numbers. The program should then output the numbers in ascending order.

Once you have your program running correctly, click the Tests button in the Tools section on the lower left of the window in Replit. Click the Run Tests button to run the tests to verify your code is producing the correct output. These tests are only there to help you see if you're on the right track. Passing all of the tests does not guarantee anything to do with your final grade on this assignment.

### Sample Output
#### Sample Output # 1
```
Enter three numbers: 3 7 1

The numbers in ascending order are: 1 3 7
```

#### Sample Output # 2
```
Enter three numbers: 12 8 5

The numbers in ascending order are: 5 8 12
```
#### Sample Output # 3
```
Enter three numbers: 300 200 400

The numbers in the ascending order are: 200 300 400
```
## Grading
Your code will be graded on a variety of factors.

### Requirements
Your program must meet all the requirements stated in the challenge. Points will be deducted for missing requirements. 

### Style and Form
Your code must be formatted neatly and consistently. See the "Form and Style" section of Chapter 2 along with the examples shown in the textbook.
Text in output should be spelled correctly.

### Comments
Your source code file should have the following comments at the top of the file:
```
// Name: Type your name here.
// Lab: Type the lab number here.
// Due Date: Type the due date here.
// Filename: Type the name of the file here.
// Description: Type a brief description of the program here.
```

The description should be at least one full sentence. I should be able to read the comment and understand what the code does without having to look at the code.

Also, include comments throughout the code that explain the code. Check out the example at the following link:

Note: Your comment at the top of your code will follow the guidelines above, but the way the rest of the code is commented is what you're striving for.

### Other
Automatic zeroes will be given for the following:

- Code that does not compile.
- Violations of the Academic Integrity Policy of the syllabus.
- Failure to follow instructions.
